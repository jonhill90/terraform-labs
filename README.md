# Terraform Labs v2 🚀

Modern Azure Landing Zone built with Azure Verified Modules (AVM) and cloud-native principles.

## Quick Start

1. **Setup**: Review `ToDo.md` for the roadmap
2. **Platforms**: Start with `platforms/hub` for networking foundation
3. **Environments**: Configure your target environment in `environments/`
