# AI Ops System

## Overview
The AI Ops System is designed to automate IT operations by leveraging AI-driven agents for monitoring, incident resolution, change management, and deployment automation. Each agent utilizes a specialized **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** model tailored to its domain, ensuring optimized performance and decision-making. These agents all interact with a **Central AI Knowledgebase** that serves as the system's collective intelligence.

## RAG Model Architecture
Each agent is backed by a domain-specific Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model pipeline. This pipeline typically uses LangChain for orchestration, calling an LLM (such as GPT-4, Claude, or Llama2 via Ollama) alongside a vector store like FAISS, Milvus, or Azure AI Search. These RAG models are updated continuously from the Central AI Knowledgebase, allowing each agent to make context-aware decisions with minimal latency.

## Data Flow Overview
1. Source data (logs, metrics, configs) flows into a central Data Lake (e.g., Delta Lake or Azure Blob Storage).
2. Databricks ETL pipelines process and normalize this data into Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers.
3. Agents query structured data and their own vector stores for semantic matching and historical insights.
4. LLMs generate suggested actions or decisions.
5. Power Automate executes workflows or approvals based on agent decisions.
6. Agent outcomes and human feedback are recorded back into the Central AI Knowledgebase for learning.

## Databricks Lakehouse Architecture

Databricks serves as the **data backbone** for the AI Ops system. It implements a **Lakehouse pattern**, combining the flexibility of a data lake with the performance and structure of a data warehouse.

## Layer-by-Layer Operations

This section details what happens in each data layer and where operations occur — from raw ingestion to AI agent reasoning.

### 🟫 Bronze Layer – Raw Ingested Data

**Purpose:** Capture source data exactly as-is, unfiltered and untransformed.

## Example Flow: IT Admin Patch Report Request

This flow illustrates how an IT admin can request a patch compliance report. The system pulls relevant data from the Gold Layer, formats the report using a Canva template with the organization's branding, and returns a visually polished PDF with insights.
