## 🚀 Implementation Roadmap

### 🏗️ Phase 1: Platform Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
Deploy core platform services that enable everything else.

| Domain | Status | Key Components | Dependencies |
|--------|--------|----------------|--------------|
| 🌐 **[Connectivity](platform/connectivity/ToDo.md)** | 🔴 | Hub-spoke VNets, DNS, peering | None (start here) |
| 🔐 **[Identity](platform/identity/ToDo.md)** | 🔴 | Azure AD, Key Vaults, RBAC | Connectivity |
| 📊 **[Management](platform/management/ToDo.md)** | 🔴 | Monitoring, governance, cost mgmt | Connectivity, Identity |
| 🔄 **[DevOps](platform/devops/ToDo.md)** | 🔴 | Azure DevOps as code, agents | All platform domains |

### 🎯 Phase 2: Application Workloads (Weeks 3-4)
Deploy business value applications leveraging platform foundation.

| Domain | Status | Key Components | Dependencies |
|--------|--------|----------------|--------------|
| 🗄️ **[Data](application/data/ToDo.md)** | 🔴 | Synapse, Databricks, AI Foundry | Platform foundation |
| 💻 **[Compute](application/compute/ToDo.md)** | 🔴 | VMs, containers, image bakery | Platform foundation |
| 🔗 **[Integration](application/integration/ToDo.md)** | 🔴 | API-M, Logic Apps, Event Grid | Platform foundation |
| 🎓 **[Labs](application/labs/ToDo.md)** | 🔴 | DP-203, AZ-104 certification | Data, Compute domains |

## 🧠 Architecture Decisions (Based on Sandbox Learning)

### ✅ Proven Patterns (Keep)
- **Multi-subscription hub-spoke** - Works great for enterprise scale
- **Azure DevOps as infrastructure** - Enables self-service capabilities
- **Private endpoints everywhere** - Security without complexity
- **Domain-driven separation** - Clear ownership and boundaries
- **Managed identities over service principals** - Better security posture

### 🚀 Evolution Areas (AVM + Modern)
- **Azure Verified Modules** adoption for standard resources
- **Simplified folder structure** while maintaining domain separation
- **Enhanced AI/data integration** with Azure AI Foundry
- **Modern container platforms** alongside traditional VMs
- **Advanced monitoring** and cost optimization

### 🏢 Enterprise Integration
- **Real Azure DevOps patterns** that work in corporate environments
- **Comprehensive RBAC** across multiple subscriptions
- **Cost management** and governance automation
- **Learning and development** platform for team growth
- **Security and compliance** by design

## 🔄 Getting Started

### 1. Domain Selection
Choose a domain based on priority and dependencies:
- **Start with Connectivity** (required foundation)
- **Then Identity** (security foundation)
- **Add Management** (operational foundation)
- **Deploy DevOps** (automation foundation)
- **Build Applications** (business value)

### 2. Domain Development
Each domain has its own detailed ToDo.md with:
- Specific components and tasks
- AVM evolution strategy
- Integration points
- Success criteria

### 3. Implementation Pattern
```bash
# Navigate to domain
cd platform/connectivity

# Review domain roadmap
cat ToDo.md

# Implement domain components
# ... domain-specific work ...

# Integrate with other domains
# ... cross-domain integration ...
```
